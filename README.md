# Learning-Management-System
The Learning Management System (LMS) developed in Python streamlines secure user registration and data management. It captures and validates details like name, CNIC, email, and password. Featuring Admin and User modes, admins manage the system and users, while users can register, update info, and access learning resources securely.
